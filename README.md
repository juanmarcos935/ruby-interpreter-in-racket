  <li><h4>Technologies used:</h4>Racket</li>
  <li><h4>Approximate date:</h4>Second semester of 2018</li>
  <li><h4>Purpose:</h4>It's the final project of the Programming Languages course (sort of Compilers course) of college. It is a Ruby-like interpreter wrote in Racket programming language, using SLLGEN library (this library is special for helping to create syntax and grammar rules in order to build a new language). By doing this project i learned about syntax specification, grammar specification of Programming Languages, closures, strings, expressions and more. It supports a lot of operations (and his syntax is very similar to Ruby) like arithmetic operations, loops, variables, booleans, conditionals and more.</li>
